Writing a blog post with Jekyll goes like this:

1. Find your Computer
2. Fire up your favorit editor (e.g. Sublime Text 2)
3. Write the blog post
4. Commit


## What is the problem with that?

You have to be on your Computer and have everything setup to commit to your GitHub acccount. You could argue that this is fine in 99% percent of the cases, but in those where you don't have access to your computer you can't fix that annyoing typo someone pointed out to you and you are so deeply ashamed of.

## How to fix it?

Meet [Prose.io](http://prose.io) I just found it 10 Minutes ago and am writing this blog post!
